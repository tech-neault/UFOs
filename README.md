## Overview
With this project, our goal is to help Dana build a functional website to help Believers and Skeptics alike look into UFO sighting data. We've updated the website functionality to include searching for date, location (city/state/country) and shape of the sightings.

Using sighting data in JSON format, our new website displays filtered search results in a table.
