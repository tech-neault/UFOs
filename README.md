# UFOs

## Overview
With this project, our goal is to help Dana build a functional website to help Believers and Skeptics alike look into UFO sighting data. We've updated the website functionality to include searching for date, location (city/state/country) and shape of the sightings. 

## Results
Using sighting data in JSON format, our new website displays filtered search results in a table. Users can enter a specific city, state, and country, the shape of the object in the sighting, and a date in MM/DD/YYYY format. These search parameters will return sightings that match, in a table format. Users can enter just one parameter, or specify each one, to return a search result.

## Summary 
This website provides functional search parameters - for the data it's connected to. In order further improve this functionality, we could add a webscraping component that can feed real-time data into the searchable database. 

Additionally, we could include some extra 'fun' components like an arts submission section where individuals can send in drawings, poems, etc. to be included in another tab. This will keep the website fun and engaging.
